   after the second draw Football you can insert another score for each player (as was instructed).
   But if there is a draw at Basketball or second draw at Tennis or third draw at Football , there is no solution for this, you will
   have to exit the "Game" window and start the matches again.
2) The TextFields at the "Game" window may be little messy.
   For instance if there are two competing players with different name lengths , the two TextFields for the same match wont be one under
   the other, one will be more right or left then the other .
